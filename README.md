# plant-image-segmentation-DeepLabv3

This project is to apply **semantic segementation** on plant images. Original plant images are downloaded from google image search and cropped to a squared fix size. Mask images are generated using [plantcv] (https://plantcv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package and manual manipulation. The backgroud is painted by black color while the plant area is highlighted by white color.
